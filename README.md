# MudaeFarm

**Warning**: selfbots are officially banned. It is considered an API abuse and is [no longer tolerated](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-).

~~So please don't be caught using this bot.~~

This is a simple bot I wrote in a few hours that automatically rolls and claims Mudae waifus/husbandos.

## Setup

1. Install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

2. Download this repository [as a zip](https://github.com/phosphene47/MudaeFarm/archive/master.zip).

3. Once the file is downloaded, unzip it. Move into the folder named `MudaeFarm` and create a file called `config.json` with the following contents:

```json
{
  "AuthToken": "INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}
```

You can find your user token: press Ctrl+Shift+I or Command+Option+I while on Discord which opens Chrome inspector then click on the tab named `Network`. Click on `XHR`.

Open a channel on Discord which should create a request called `science`.

Under `Request Headers` find your authorization token and copy that.

DO NOT EVER SHARE THIS TOKEN WITH ANYONE. SHARING THIS TOKEN IS SHARING YOUR PASSWORD.

4. Open terminal or cmd in the folder and run the following commands: `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`

### Note

This bot does not automatically know which Mudae maid you are using. You may need to copy the ID of Mudae maid bot and add it in `MudaeFarm/Program.cs`:

```csharp
public static ulong[] MudaeIds = new ulong[]
{
    PASTE_MUDAE_MAID_ID_HERE
};
```

## Commands

Autoclaiming:

- `/wish {character}` — Adds a character to your wishlist.
- `/unwish {character}` — Removes a character from your wishlist.
- `/wishani {anime}` — Adds an anime to your wishlist. This is akin to wishing every character from that anime.
- `/unwishani {anime}` — Removes an anime from your wishlist.
- `/wishlist` — Shows the list of your wished characters.
- `/wishlistani` — Shows the list of your wished anime.

Autorolling:

- `/rollinterval {minutes}` — Sets the autoroll interval in minutes. Setting this to `-1` disables autorolling.
- `/setchannel` — Sets the channel where you send this command as a bot channel. You can do this in however many channels as you like.
- `/unsetchannel` — Stops autorolling in the channel where you send this command.
- '/marry waifu' — Sets marry target to waifus (`$w`). This is the default roll command.
- '/marry husbando' — Sets marry target husbandoes (`$h`).
